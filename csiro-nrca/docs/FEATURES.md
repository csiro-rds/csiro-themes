# Theme Features

This theme has a number of additional features compared to the default theme:

* Improved overall page layout that provides more vertical screen space.

* Look and feel consistency with (relatively) modern web applications via Bootstrap.
  
* Much less custom CSS, through use of standardised Bootstrap components.

* Grid-based form layout.  By assigning a `col-md-*` class to bundles via the bundle editor user interface, and using
  the "New Group" option to cause a new wrapper element with a `row` class, the bundles can be arranged into columns
  and rows.

* User-controlled view settings including font size, padding size, margin size and collapsible sidebar.
